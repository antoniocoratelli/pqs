Rule for combining dimensions

A dimension has a set of unique base-dimension-exponents.

Each base-dimension-exponent has a unique associated associated base-dimension.

An operation on 2 dimensions has an associated base-dimension-set consisting of all unique base-dimensions in both quantities.

for any operation on two dimensions the associated base-dimension-set must be compile-time totally-ordered

so there needs to be some compile time function concepts

template <typename T>
concept meta_bool_function = ?
// i have defined it using enable if T has some value convertible to compile time bool

template <typename TL, typename TR>
concept meta_equality_comparable = meta_bool_function< meta_equal_to<TL,TR> >;

template <typename TL, typename TR>
concept meta_less_than_comparable = meta_bool_function< meta_less<TL,TR> >;

template <typename Tq, typename T2>
concept meta_totally_ordered = meta_less_than_comparable<T1,T2> && meta_equality_comparable<T1,T2>;

template <typename BD, typename System>
concept is_base_dimension;

requires (base_dimension Tless<Lhs_base_dimension, Rhs_base_dimension> -> compile time bool

equal_to<Lhs_base_dimension, Rhs_base_dimension>

Further. Any
