conversion_factor 

represents the scaling of the quantity from the base quantity

conversion factor can be
   base_conversion_factor -> The exponent is 0 and multiplier is 1
   coherent_conversion_factor   -> the exp is an integer and multiplier is 1
   rational_coherent_conversion_factor -> the exp is a rational and multiplier is 1
   incoherent_conversion_factor -> the multiplier is not 1, may be rational, or the multiplier is 1 but has an id to distinguish from cohernet_conversion_factor
    

operations
   
ratio get_exponent() ;  return the base 10 exponent of the scaling factor
ratio get_multiplier() ; return the multiplier of the conversion factor
multiplier will be one for coherent quantities.
id option to mark the conversion_factor in a special way or be anonymous : maybe name or by derivation


most simple type of conversion factor is base_conversion_factor

get_exponent (basic_conversion_factor) { return std::ratio<0> ;}
get_multiplier ( basic_conversion_factor) { return 1 ; }
is_anonymous(basic_conversion_factor) { return true;}
