The mux_exp represents a conversion_factor. Maybe call it that?

conversion factor has a multiplier which is ratio and and exponent which is an integer or a rational in rare cases

in context of q1, q2 quantities represnting the same value, where v is the value and k is the conversion_factor

 q{
  value v;
  conversion_factor k;
}

q q1, q2;
if ( q1 == q2)
implies
q1.v * q1.k ==  q2.v * q2.k

conversion_factor ops

can conversion_factor be zero ? , theoretically yes.

addition - no. It is a factor so only multiplied by

scaling - yes

multiplication by other conversion_factor ?
