"The explicit formulation of the idea of the dimensions, or the exponents of dimension, of physical quantities was
first made by Fourier, Theorie de la Chaleur, 1822 ch.ii, sec. 9. The homogeneity in dimensions of all the terms of
an equation is insisted on by him, much as explained above; and the use of this principle as a test of accuracy and
precision is ilustrated.
