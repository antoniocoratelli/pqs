dimension concept is a property of a quantity that can be used for dimensional_analysis

represented as either a base_quantity_exp or a list of base_quantity_exp

base_quantity_exp  | list<base_quantity_exp...>

dimension may be made of base_quantity_exps from different quantity_universe_types, 
but not including base_quantity_exps from different quantity_universes of same type.
  
For example dimension cannot be comprised of a base_dimension_exp from newtonian(physical type) and relativistic(physical type)
   but could be comprised of newtonian(type physical ) and information(type information)
